## Code Overview

### HTML (`index.html`)
- The HTML file contains the structure of the Doraemon face, including the eyes, nose, mouth, and mustache.

### CSS (`style.css`)
- The CSS file styles the Doraemon face and its components, including the custom cursor and hover effects.

### JavaScript (`app.js`)
- The JavaScript file handles the logic for making the eyes follow the mouse cursor. It calculates the angle between the eye and the cursor and applies a rotation transform to the eyes.

## Customization

You can customize the project by modifying the CSS variables in the `:root` selector to change colors, sizes, and other properties. Additionally, you can adjust the JavaScript logic to alter the behavior of the eyes.
